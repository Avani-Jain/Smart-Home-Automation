# Smart-Home-Automation

OBJECTIVE

Nowadays, we have remote controls for our television sets and other electronic system, which have made our lives really easy. The main objective of this project is to implement a low cost, reliable and scalable Home Automation System that can be switched on and off according to the distance calculated by the distance sensors. This project will be useful for conserving electricity and providing convince to the user. This project is to automatically switch on or off an electrical appliance connected to it in accordance to the distance of the object with the sensor. 
This system is super-cost effective and can give user to control and electronically device connected to it, without even spending for a remote control.

CONCLUSION

This work can be carried forward by integrating relays to Raspberry pi board for controlling home appliances in a real scenario.  As an extension, it is proposed that a generic IoT framework and cloud computing infrastructure for connecting and managing be used. Expected to grow in popularity in the near future is the use of smart home products to increase family safety, specifically related to fire protection and carbon monoxide monitoring.
